# falling-sand-simulator

This is a falling sand simulator written in python using the pygame module, inspiration and logic come from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4u7Zy_b868 by The Coding Train.
I wanted to recreate this as a way to get practice in cellular automata and as a challenge to rewrite the original code that was in JavaScript into Python to gain a deeper understanding of the two languages.

Functions exactly as shown in the video, to use the program would first have to install pygame using the command:
```
pip install pygame
```
or to use the exact version I used during the writing of this program using the `requirements.txt`
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

With the module install simply run the program with:
```
python main.py
```
